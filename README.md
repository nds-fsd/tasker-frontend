# Tasker

This is the frontend part of a two-repositories project. This project is an attempt to build a "tasker" app. This project was just an experiment meant to help me learn building a frontend and backend app.
Just already is in construction.

##Libraries
- React
- react-router
- react-icons
- react-select
- classnames
- date-fns
- material UI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs frontend of the app. Expects the backend to be running on localhost:3001.
